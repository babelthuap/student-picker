#Student Picker
by Nicholas Neumann-Chun
*homework assignment for Coding House on 28 Oct 2015*

This is a simmple app that allows the user to
- build a list of students (optionally with comma-separated input)
- delete a student from the list
- pick a random student from the list
- shuffle the list
- sort the list alphabetically
- split the list into teams of a specified size

There's a little easter egg in there, too.
